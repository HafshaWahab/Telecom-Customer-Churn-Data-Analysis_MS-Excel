## Background
The comprehensive analysis of churn data from a hypothetical Telecom company in California reveals critical insights into customer behaviour, service preferences, and churn patterns. This report synthesizes data from 7,043 customers to devise strategies that bolster customer retention and operational efficiency.

## Goals & KPIs
The primary goal was to curtail customer attrition by enhancing the customer experience and service offerings. Key performance indicators included customer retention rates, average revenue per user (ARPU), and service adoption rates.

## Findings
•	Customer Demographics: The highest churn was observed among customers aged 39-58, indicating a potential disconnect with this demographic’s needs or expectations.

•	Service Preferences: Bank withdrawals emerged as the preferred payment method, suggesting a trend towards traditional payment options among churned users. The fiber optic was the most used internet service. 

•	Geographic Trends: San Diego and Los Angeles topped the list of cities with the highest churn rates, pointing to possible regional service issues.

•	Product Insights: Internet services, particularly fiber optic connections, were widely used among customers, highlighting the importance of robust digital offerings.

## Suggestions to Client
•	**Enhance Offers:** Roll out more compelling promotions, particularly those similar to Offer E, which resonated well with the target audience.

•	**Improve Customer Service:** Foster a culture of positive and polite customer interactions to build loyalty and trust.

•	**Payment Flexibility:** Simplify payment processes and explore more digital payment options to cater to customer convenience.

•	**Targeted Interventions:** Develop age-specific retention strategies, especially for the 39-58 age group, to address their unique needs.

## Conclusion
The analysis underscores the significance of targeted marketing, exceptional customer service, and convenient payment solutions in mitigating churn. By implementing the suggested strategies, the Telecom company can expect to see a marked improvement in customer loyalty and a reduction in churn rates.
